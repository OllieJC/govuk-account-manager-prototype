        Hello

        You’ve finished creating your GOV.UK account.

        GOV.UK accounts are a trial. They’re a first step towards creating a GOV.UK that is more tailored to you and your circumstances.

        At the moment, you can only use your account with the UK transition checker (%{transition_checker_link}) to:

          - get email updates about UK transition changes that may affect you
          - save your UK transition checker results

        In future, we want to add more features to your account so you can:

          - see content that’s more tailored to you
          - get recommendations for services relevant to you
          - get updates about guidance that might be helpful to you
          - reuse data about you between different services

        If you have any questions, problems or suggestions for how we could make your GOV.UK account better, please give us feedback (%{feedback_link}).

        Sign in to your GOV.UK account (%{login_link})
